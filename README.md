### Hi there, I'm Serkan ðŸ‘‹

As a recent graduate in Economics from TOBB University of Economics and Technology, I have a solid foundation in the subject. In addition to that, I work as a freelance data scientist, continuously updating my skills and sharing new knowledge and projects through my blog. With multiple certifications and bootcamps in the field of data science, I am currently focused on advancing my expertise in data engineering.
